          <h1>"Bezoitera"</h1>
          <p> Never in history did people live in complete harmony, without war or conflict. 
            It is not possible with how people are wired. But the planet Bezoitera has been in balance for eighty years. 
            A complete artificial ecological system was built to preserve life on Bezoitera and its two million inhabitants. 
            That all took a turn for the worse when it happened: C/2102 H1, 
            the comet that reduced the largest artificial agricultural land area by 70% overnight. 
            The produce was shared by the two largest civilizations in the northern hemisphere. 
            Traditional farming was not possible on Bezoitera, so it took years to develop its frail farms. 
            Altraa and Uaphnex entered their biggest crisis in years. </p>

          <h1>"Bloodshed"</h1>
          <p> Like all civilized governments, an urgent meeting was held. 
            No protocol was written for a disaster of this scale. 
            Two years of deliberation did not feed the hungry mouths. Large funds were needed to revive barren land. 
            Prices for food went through the roof, and crime arose on the remaining farmlands. 
            People who felt abandoned by their governments went into full anarchy mode. 
            Thousands of lives were lost in the first few months. With no resolve, this escalated into an interstate war. 
            All rational thinking was suppressed by the sole will to protect and feed their citizens. 
            Fences grew from the ground like weeds on fertile soil. Farms were protected like pirates’ treasure. </p>

          <h1>"Exile"</h1>
          <p> Altraa began to deteriorate, casting lots on its own people with barbaric intentions. 
            In secret, its government started restoring old spacecrafts to exile citizens to a nearby planet called Vaonus, 
            a well-observed planet known to contain life, but with unknown dangers. 
            It started with the spread of letters for voluntary participation, 
            but this did not succeed because people were too skeptical about this plan. 
            Moreover, they believed they would win the war, farms would be rebuilt even better and life would flourish again. 
            The hope given by deceitful propaganda. Within a month, 
            a third of the population was held hostage on ships with enough fuel for a single trip to Vaonus. </p>

          <h1>"Aftermath"</h1>
          <p>Five years, half a million deaths and no word from Vaonus after the arrival of the three spacecrafts. 
            Farms on Bezoitera were slowly being rebuilt with the limited resources available. 
            This, along with losing a fourth of people by death and deporting a sixth into space, led to a balance in the food supply. 
            An uprising of people caused an uproar in Altraa. 
            People never heard back from friends and family that were sent to Vaonus. 
            The government never shed light on the situation on Vaonus and told everything was great. </p>

          <h1>"Infestation"</h1>
          <p>Death awaited the 300.000 terrified passengers on the space vessels. 
            Upon arriving on Vaonus everything seemed peaceful. As a massive unity, 
            people started developing a livable habitat for themselves as their survival instinct kicked in.
            After a year of being on the planet, cohabitants surfaced and made an introduction. 
            Ruthless and brutal creatures penetrated structures and slaughtered thousands of people. 
            All while being observed from Bezoitera. The government, full of guilt and fear, decided it was best to hide this from the masses.
             People needed the hope the exiled were thriving on Vaonus. The government could not afford another revolt. </p>

          <h1>"Remorse"</h1>
          <p>As everything calmed down on Bezoitera, a wave of disgust fell over Altraa. 
            Thousands of individuals were deported to their deaths as a result of the crisis. 
            Altraa launched an emergency mission to save survivors on Vaonus. A team of explorers had been assembled. 
            The tension on Bezoitera left a silence as the little spacecraft blasted out of the atmosphere with a massive boom. 
            After a week of flight, the vessel landed on Vaonus. Days went by… </p>

          <h1>"Desolated"</h1>
          <p>Finally, Vaonus sent word. A crew member found a survivor. Weak, agonized and in despair, 
            a woman fell on her knees with a child covered in a blanket. She was praying for help to save the deceased child. 
            It seemed like the mother was confused and disordered. 
            There was nothing left in the colony that had been built except the presence of death and the crawling of alien creatures. 
            Word spread around Altraa and Uaphnex about this tragedy. People were angry with their government. 
            How could they have been so reckless in sending family and friends to their deaths? In times of war, 
            people can be cruel and irrational. </p>
